		<h3>What is wrong with the current publishing model?</h3>
		
		<h4>The gift of Exchange</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society is the world's longest-running scientific journal and 
			was established in 1665. The Royal Society was steadfast in its not-yet-popular belief that science 
			could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence. 
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			As a result, for nearly 300 years, a system known as the "gift of exchange" was in place, in which almost 
			all scholarly work, with the exception of proprietary research, was made freely available to the public.
		</p>
		<h4>Commercialising Academic Research</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Unfortunately, this system is no longer in place today. In the 1960’s and 1970’s commercial publishers 
			recognised that academic publishing was commercially viable and started to selectively purchase top-quality 
			journals owned by non-profit academic societies. They saw an opportunity to profit from the distribution 
			of publicly financed research. Since the demand for academic journals is relatively inelastic, especially 
			in the case of university libraries, publishers were able to increase prices significantly allowing 
			for astronomical profit margins.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			With almost 55% of the market share in 2020, four major publishers namely Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, and 
			Taylor & Francis dominate the academic journal industry. These powerful publishing houses have a history 
			of merging, acquiring, and launching new journals to diversify their journal portfolios. Modern academic 
			publishing is based on a unique economic model in which all of the necessary publishing inputs are 
			provided free of charge. As part of a larger scholarly endeavour, academics provide a key economic 
			input that is then commercialised by publishers as part of the process of dissemination. 
		</p>
		<h4>The Serials Crisis</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			In the United States, commercial journal publishers hiked prices by 310% between 1975 and 1995. Budgets 
			for university libraries normally only increase in line with CPI inflation, which in the United States 
			was 183% between 1975 and 1995. As a result, the serials crisis began in the 1990s, when an increasing 
			number of university library budgets were unable to keep up with rising journal prices. Overall, the ratio 
			of journal expenditures to total library materials expenditures climbed from 53% in 1986 to 73% in 2011, 
			with expenditures on other categories of resources, such as monographs, falling by 21%. 	
		</p>

		<h4>The Big Deal</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			'The Big Deal' was a significant event in academic publishing history where instead of selling individual 
			journals to university libraries, publishers grouped them into bundle deals, thereby granting them access 
			to entire journal collections in exchange for a fixed yearly subscription fee. It was cleverly designed to 
			ensure libraries had either all or none of the journals. This made publishers become more profitable with 
			the example of Elsevier's operating profits climbing by more than 400% between 1991 and 2013, and its profit 
			margin never dipping below 30% throughout the period. 
		</p>

		<h4>Taking a Stand</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Following a dispute over access to research publications, Norway and Sweden along with individual universities 
			from other countries have discontinued their contracts with the likes of Elsevier. This was an attempt for a 
			sustainable transition to Open Access (OA). However, the OA movement has become a crisis itself in that commercial 
			publishers have appeased public scrutiny and provided hybrid journals that are both subscription based and open 
			access model that has proven to charge higher prices on average than standalone open access journals.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			The Academic society has come up with vast solutions to combat the unsustainable rise in prices one of which is 
			the library-press partnerships. The library has taken on a new role in scholarly publishing, forming partnerships 
			with university presses to encourage universities to develop comprehensive publishing plans that draw on the expertise 
			and resources of several departments within the institution, including the library, press, and academic computing centre. 
			In the more liberating space, Sci-Hub pulls paid scientific publications from major publishers and makes them freely 
			available to the public. Sci-Hub was founded on the notion that granting copyrights to scientific works and placing 
			paywalls on them stifles society's advancement. 	
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Given this premise, the development of Aaron’s Toolkit was created to complement society’s actions by decentralising 
			scholarly work to ensure censorship resistance to fight back and honour Aaron Swartz Guerilla Open Access Manifesto 
			“You have a duty to share it with the world”.

		<h3>What is Open Access?</h3>


		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Open Access (OA) is a broad international movement and seeks to grant free and immediate 
			online access to academic research outputs such as journal articles, books and data. It
			is in opposition to the traditional subscription based publishing model, which allows users 
			to access scholarly information by purchasing a subscription (usually via libraries).
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify"> 
			A Publication is considered open access when there are no financial, legal, or technical 
			restrictions to accessing it. Thus, within the legal agreements, anybody may freely read, 
			download, copy, search for, and use a publication in any way.
			Many journals now offer various "open access like" models in which they charge researchers
			a once off fee to make their scholarly output freely accessible.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Even though Open Access has become very popular over the past several years and is a positive 
			development, it is not without its drawbacks:
		</p>
		<CtaCardSection>
			<p><u><b>Article Processing Charges (APCs)</b></u></p>
			<p>
				Researchers often have to pay substantial costs to journals to make their research freely 
				available. APC charges vary, and cost on average $1000, where the most prestigious journals 
				charge upwards of $5000. 
			</p>
			<p><u><b>Scarse Open Access Journals</b></u></p>
			<p>
				The number of Open Access or Hybrid journals vary greatly across disciplines. Some disciplines 
				have very few and often not enough.
			</p>
			<p><u><b>Predatory Publishing</b></u></p>
			<p>	 
				Predatory journals, a term used for journals of dubious quality, slow down the open access 
				movement as their continuous spamming of researchers may taint their perception of open 
				access.

		<h3>What role will Aaron's Kit play?</h3>

		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Aaron's kit strives to become the world’s first and largest repository of complete journals 
			behind paywalls that will be available to the public for free. Scholarship a.k.a. knowledge,
			is a public good, and hence the content of scholarly journals, is a public good. Public goods 
			are free to consume, and therefore, access to scholarly journals should be free as well.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify">
			Aaron’s kit captures the vision of Aaron Swartz. Our project is your project and by joining 
			forces, we can continue Aaron’s legacy — to transform the antiquated system of academic 
			publishing into an open access community.
